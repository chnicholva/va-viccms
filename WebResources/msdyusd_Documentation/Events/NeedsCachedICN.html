                Evoked through JavaScript window.open calls when a record that should have a value in its Cached ICN lookup field but does not. Action calls beneath a control's respective events should create a new ftp_cachedicn record and link it to the event's parent record.

                <br />
                "Record Needs Cached ICN: Create Cached ICN Record"
                <br />
